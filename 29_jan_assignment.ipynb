    "Ans. Memory management in Python involves a private heap containing all Python objects and data structures.

The Python memory manager has different components which deal with various dynamic storage management aspects, like sharing, segmentation, preallocation or caching.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "At the lowest level, a raw memory allocator ensures that there is enough room in the private heap for storing all Python-related data by interacting with the memory manager of the operating system. On top of the raw memory allocator, several object-specific allocators operate on the same heap and implement distinct memory management policies adapted to the peculiarities of every object type. For example, integer objects are managed differently within the heap than strings, tuples or dictionaries because integers imply different storage requirements and speed/space tradeoffs. The Python memory manager thus delegates some of the work to the object-specific allocators, but ensures that the latter operate within the bounds of the private heap."
